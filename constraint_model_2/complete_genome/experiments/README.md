TESTING DATA:

test_matrix.tsv is the example whole-genome contact map depicted in figure 3 an 4 of the paper titled: "COCO-HoliC: Predicting the 3D Chromosomal Organization with Constraints and Hi-C data".

The corresponding ECLiPSe file for this matrix can be generated by invoking the following command:

./generate_model2.pl test_matrix.tsv 10 >./test_matrix.ecl

test_matrix.ecl complied in 0.52 seconds and found the optimal solution in 0.01 seconds. 

test_matrix.ecl produces the following output:

[eclipse 2]: maximize(R, F).
Found a solution with cost 0
Found a solution with cost -4
Found a solution with cost -9
Found a solution with cost -17
Found a solution with cost -18
Found no solution with cost -34.0 .. -19.0

R = [2, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0]
F = [1, 0, 8, 9, 0, 0]

===============================================================================

YEAST DATA:

The S. pombe whole-genome contact map can be found at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1379427

The corresponding ECLiPSe file for this matrix can be generated by invoking the following command:

./generate_model2.pl <location of S. pombe whole-genome contact map> 1000 >./constraint_model_2_pombe.ecl

constraint_model_2_pombe.ecl complied in 68.82 seconds

note: to compile constraint_model_2_pombe.ecl in ECLiPSe, you must increase the global stack size using the -g option

Invoking maximize(R, F). results in: the program running for > 24 hours without finding a solution.
